# Twitter-bot

This is a twitter bot programmed to automatically post the latest updates from a facebook group. The bot is programmed in Python, using the Tweepy Twitter API to communicate with the server and upload posts, as well as the Facebook-Scraper API to collect the latest messages from a public group and write to a local file.
